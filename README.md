## Arduino-28BYJ48_Stepper
#### *Arduino 28BYJ48 Stepper Motor .H and .CCP*

This is my first customizing of a header file for an arduino project. In it I have combined from a couple of sources to create a set of features which allow for moving the motor either continuously _Clockwise & AntiClockwise_, as well as moving by _incremented number of steps_.
